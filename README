
A PHP project using an imported seeder to populate a mysql database while using sockets to create a realtime-feed feature.

Once my database was seeded with names and words, I randomly picked users and words to be paired up and displayed this information every 5 seconds. I also created a list of words (blockedwords) that will not appear as the words that were paired up with the names.

Sockets: 
- get all users(names), blocked words, and words from db and store in arrays
- check blockedwords versus words and display those words that are NOT contained within each other
- create an interval function to control the amount of information to be displayed with a specific time

Components needed:
-composer
-faker
-Seeder class
 Imported a seeder class from  Kenji Suzuki (<https://github.com/kenjis>) 

My Users database table has the following columns:
- id 
- full_name
- email 
- city 
- created_at
***Only full_name needed for this project***

My Words database table has the following columns: 
- id
- word
- created_at

My BlockedWords database table has the following columns: 
- id
- word
